Designed for regeneration and reuse, they enable sustainable anion sequestration through physical triggers such as light, heat, pH, and inhibitors. Innovations include reversible phosphate capture via redox and cavitand-based mechanisms, and selective bicarbonate binding through cationic complexes under oceanic conditions. These catch-and-release systems pave the way for recyclable materials and membrane technologies capable of extracting anions from water, contributing to green chemistry and environmental remediation efforts.",Department of Chemistry,"315 S 1400 E, SALT LAKE CITY, UT 84112",Campus,Chemistry,Collaborators Unavailable,
Hayley Kievman,Fall 25,Graduate,How did people respond to rapidly changing ecologies during the Pleistocene-Holocene Transition?,"This project investigates how ecological changes during the Pleistocene-Holocene Transition (PHT) influenced the migration and subsistence strategies of early populations in central California. Using stable isotope analysis of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and strontium from human and faunal remains at a newly discovered \~11,000-year-old site, the study reconstructs ancient environments. In collaboration with the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe, it integrates Indigenous knowledge with scientific methods to better understand past human-environment interactions. By centering tribal voices often excluded from climate science, this research offers new insights into early adaptation strategies and contributes to more inclusive interpretations of environmental and cultural history.",Central California,"36.86038314435239, -120.1701135996639",World,Anthropology,Collaborators Unavailable,
Lewis Kunik,Fall 25,Graduate,"Leveraging novel satellite observations to understand vegetation drought, mortality, and carbon dynamics in Western US forests","This dissertation investigates how drought and insect-driven mortality affect forest productivity in the Western U.S., a key region for carbon storage and ecosystem services. Amid increasing climate-related disturbances and limited monitoring infrastructure, the research uses novel satellite observations—sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and photoprotective pigment indices—to track photosynthetic responses to stress. By integrating these signals with ground-based CO₂ flux data, biogeochemical models, and regional drought and mortality metrics, the study reveals how forest productivity has changed over two decades. The findings will enhance forest monitoring tools, inform land management, and improve understanding of forest-climate feedbacks in a rapidly changing environment.",Department of Atmospheric Sciences,"135 S 1460 E, Room 819, Salt Lake City, UT 84112",Campus,Atmospheric Sciences,Collaborators Unavailable,
Baylee Olds,Fall 25,Graduate,Vegetation and topographic controls on snow accumulation and ablation: Implications for the amount and timing of snowmelt-derived water resources,"This dissertation investigates how climate change and forest disturbances affect snowpack dynamics in the Western U.S., a region where snowmelt is vital for 70 million people and a \$9.8 trillion economy. Current snowmelt predictions rely on sparse monitoring, which is increasingly inadequate. This research quantifies how vegetation, topography, and climate influence snow accumulation, sublimation, and melt timing. Findings show up to 48% of snowfall can sublimate in exposed areas, while shaded areas delay melt, extending water availability. These spatial patterns inform forest management models tailored to landscape features and support decision-making for water resource planning with partners like Salt Lake City Public Utilities.",Western US Areas That Rely on Snowmelt,"40.585574871061056, -111.6011519739183",Utah,Geology and Geophysics,Collaborators Unavailable,
Abby Baka,Fall 25,Graduate,Exploring Human Responses to the Pleistocene-Holocene Transition on the Colorado Plateau,"This dissertation investigates the sparsity of archaeological evidence for human occupation on the Colorado Plateau during the Pleistocene-Holocene Transition (\~14,000–8,000 calBP), despite the region's rich subsistence resources. Using predictive modeling, pedestrian surveys, behavioral ecology, cultural transmission theory, and artifact datasets, the research aims to determine whether the apparent scarcity reflects low site density or insufficient research. It also models how environmental, technological, and cultural factors shaped regional projectile point typologies. The findings will expand the archaeological record for this understudied period and clarify how early populations adapted their lifeways to rapid climate change and shifting ecological conditions.",Colorado Plateau,"37.00051881989916, -110.00104168504986",Utah,Anthropology,Collaborators Unavailable,
